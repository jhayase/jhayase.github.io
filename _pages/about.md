Hi! I'm a 4<sup>th</sup> year PhD student at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering ](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) advised by [Sewoong Oh](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/)! I am mainly interested in security and privacy in Machine Learning.

This past summer (2023), I was a Google Student Researcher working with [Nicholas Carlini](https://nicholas.carlini.com/).
